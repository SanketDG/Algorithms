# C Algorithms and Data Structures

This is a collection of standard algorithms and data structures written in C.

# How to Use

Every algorithm has its own menu based program, which can be compiled by the `make` command.

```shell
make stack-menu
./stack-menu
```

To clean all output files, `make clean`.

# Current Implementations

## Stack
* Stack Menu Program > `make stack-menu`

## Sparse Matrix
* Sparse Matrix Representation > `make sparse-matrix`

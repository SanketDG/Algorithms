# C Algorithms and Data Structures

This is a collection of standard algorithms and data structures written in C.

# How to Use

Every algorithm has its own menu based program, which can be compiled by the `make` command.

```shell
make stack
./stack
```

# Current Algorithms

* Stack > `make stack`
* Sparse Matrix Representation > `make sparse-matrix`
